## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

### About Me
- 🔭 **Current Project**: Focusing on exam project! 🚀  
- 🌱 **Learning Journey**: My goal is to become the best in working with APIs—designing, building, and optimizing them to solve real-world problems. I’m diving deep into RESTful principles, API security, and performance optimization to reach this goal.  
- 🤔 **Looking for Opportunities**: I’m seeking an internship or a junior role where I can collaborate with experienced developers and gain hands-on experience with APIs in real-world scenarios. Mentorship and practical challenges are what I need to grow!

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (Intermediate), Python (Beginner)  
- **Backend Technologies:** REST APIs, Node.js, Express.js  
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Postman, Visual Studio Code, Swagger  
- **Databases:** Snowflake, MongoDB, MySQL, Alteryx  
- **Visualization Tools:** PowerBI  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  

---

### Learning Goals
- Master API security, including authentication (OAuth, JWT) and authorization strategies.
- Learn best practices for API documentation using Swagger and OpenAPI standards.
- Explore advanced API topics like GraphQL and real-time APIs with WebSockets.
- Understand API performance optimization and scaling using caching, load balancing, and microservices.
- Gain practical experience integrating external APIs (e.g., payment gateways, geolocation, or social media APIs).

I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with experienced developers and gain practical knowledge through feedback and hands-on learning. I'm eager to learn, open to constructive criticism, and always ready to improve.

### Fun Facts  
- ⚡ **Personal Life**: When I’m not working on APIs or debugging JavaScript, I’m enjoying life in Trondheim, Norway, with my wife and two daughters (15 and 8). Cold winters inspire warm coding sessions!  
- ⚡ **Challenge Accepted**: APIs are my passion, but solving the mystery of *who left the dishes unwashed* at home remains the hardest challenge—spoiler: it’s never the 8-year-old! 😉
