## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

### About Me
- ðŸ”­ **Current Project**: I'm building an app focused on API development, including authentication tables, map coordinate decoding, and custom code table generation. Itâ€™s a bit hard to explain, but itâ€™s a passion project where Iâ€™m mastering the art of APIs! ðŸš€  
- ðŸŒ± **Learning Journey**: My goal is to become the best in working with APIsâ€”designing, building, and optimizing them to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m diving deep into RESTful principles, API security, and performance optimization to reach this goal.  
- ðŸ¤” **Looking for Opportunities**: Iâ€™m seeking an internship or a junior role where I can collaborate with experienced developers and gain hands-on experience with APIs in real-world scenarios. Mentorship and practical challenges are what I need to grow!  

### Skills
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript (Intermediate), Python (Beginner)
- **API Development**: REST APIs, Authentication, JSON, API documentation with Swagger
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js, Postman, VS Code
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL (Basic understanding)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

### Learning Goals
- Master API security, including authentication (OAuth, JWT) and authorization strategies.
- Learn best practices for API documentation using Swagger and OpenAPI standards.
- Explore advanced API topics like GraphQL and real-time APIs with WebSockets.
- Understand API performance optimization and scaling using caching, load balancing, and microservices.
- Gain practical experience integrating external APIs (e.g., payment gateways, geolocation, or social media APIs).

I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with experienced developers and gain practical knowledge through feedback and hands-on learning. I'm eager to learn, open to constructive criticism, and always ready to improve.

### Fun Facts  
- âš¡ **Personal Life**: When Iâ€™m not working on APIs or debugging JavaScript, Iâ€™m enjoying life in Trondheim, Norway, with my wife and two daughters (15 and 8). Cold winters inspire warm coding sessions!  
- âš¡ **Challenge Accepted**: APIs are my passion, but solving the mystery of *who left the dishes unwashed* at home remains the hardest challengeâ€”spoiler: itâ€™s never the 8-year-old! ðŸ˜‰
